# SimpleCalculator
A remake of my Nim calculator but in C++ with [wxWidgets](https://www.wxwidgets.org/ "wxWidgets Homepage").

Here is a fancy image of it!

The initial calculator was in Nim, [here](https://github.com/ostanton/NimGenericVisualCalculator). However I've been learning C++ since August 2023 now, and use it a lot in Unreal and with SFML, and wanted to try a UI library, so tried wxWidgets and made this. Do I like wxWidgets? Not really. It's ok, but not very clear in how it works. Anyway, it's done and I don't think I'll use wxWidgets again unless I have to. Or I dislike the other UI libraries more, who knowsâ€½ Maybe I'll write my own. I dunno. I like the D language though so might do it there. Hey ho.
